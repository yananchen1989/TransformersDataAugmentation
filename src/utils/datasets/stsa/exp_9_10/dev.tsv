negative	problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
negative	where 's the movie here ?
negative	this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
negative	the movie 's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
negative	a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
negative	a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
negative	the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
negative	it 's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet ? ''
negative	its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
negative	a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
