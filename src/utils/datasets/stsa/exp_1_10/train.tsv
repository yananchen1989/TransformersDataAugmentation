positive	a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people .
positive	what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .
positive	an unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood .
positive	neil burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present .
