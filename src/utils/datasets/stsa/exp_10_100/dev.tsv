negative	an almost unbearably morbid love story .
negative	a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
negative	sure , i hated myself in the morning .

negative	we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
negative	confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .

negative	it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
negative	an awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work .
negative	imperfect ?

negative	after a while , hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .
negative	sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
negative	this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
negative	the movie 's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
negative	the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
negative	you come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .

negative	the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
negative	plays like john le carr√© with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .
negative	this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
negative	on a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
negative	the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
negative	a feeble tootsie knockoff .
negative	ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
negative	aggravating and tedious .
negative	no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .
negative	instead of trying to bust some blondes , -lrb- diggs -rrb- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .
negative	it 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .
